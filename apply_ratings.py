AnchorAI - apply_ratings.py (stdlib only). SEPARATE adapter.

Reads NM's canonical source ratings (~/Desktop/Scripts/sources.md, the same file
watch_routine.py uses) and annotates feed_items.json with a reliability mark. It
reuses his TRUSTED / CAUTION / BLOCKED judgements WITHOUT touching watch_routine.py
and WITHOUT importing his interest watchlist, so the board's topic intake stays
neutral (broad AI news in) while gaining his source-quality axis.

Reliability (track record) is a SECOND axis, orthogonal to motive_tier (incentive):
the two are kept separate so a source's past accuracy is not confused with its
incentive on a given claim. Blocked sources are dropped;
trusted get a star, caution get a warning plus the note. Matches on source name +
URL (domain/author), never on the headline, so an article that merely mentions a
blocked name is not dropped.

Run order:  fetch_feeds.py  ->  apply_ratings.py  ->  build.py
